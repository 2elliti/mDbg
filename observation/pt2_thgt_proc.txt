;     Part 2 Breakpoints.
;*******************************;


So we can create a breakopoint with the help of hardware( registers) or we can take help of software breakpoint(By editing running code).

So we are using software break point to get ourself started, hardware do provide some additional features but we can only do 4 breakpoint at a time(might have to check).


ok so now how do we update out ruunning program? ---->    PTRACE
